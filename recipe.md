*Whisk together in a medium size bowl the sauce ingredients. Add the tofu to the sauce and coat well and leave aside while you prepare the rest of your ingredients.

Cut the nub/base off the bok choy and cut into thin slices (the green leaves can be more roughly chopped as they will wilt down more easily and quickly when cooked.)
